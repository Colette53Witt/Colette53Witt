## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a cloud architect with hands-on experience designing and implementing scalable, secure, and cost-effective infrastructure solutions across AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. This space serves as a portfolio of cloud architecture patterns, infrastructure-as-code templates, automation scripts, and reference projects that reflect my approach to building reliable systems in the cloud.

My work focuses on crafting well-architected solutions that meet business and technical requirements across different industries. I specialize in designing cloud-native systems, ensuring they are resilient, highly available, and optimized for performance. Whether it's setting up multi-cloud strategies, configuring hybrid cloud connectivity, or leveraging managed services, I strive to align architecture with long-term scalability and maintainability.

This repository features examples of infrastructure automation using tools like Terraform and CloudFormation, container orchestration using Kubernetes, and architectural templates for compute, networking, storage, and identity management. I follow best practices for security, including IAM policies, encryption standards, and network segmentation, ensuring that each solution adheres to compliance and governance needs.

Having worked with AWS, GCP, and Azure, Iâ€™m able to design cloud solutions that make the most of each providerâ€™s strengths. From serverless architectures and microservices deployments to setting up CI/CD pipelines and monitoring frameworks, I focus on end-to-end solutions that support development, operations, and business teams alike.

Feel free to browse the projects, clone code examples, or contribute to the discussions. I welcome feedback, collaboration, and shared insights from others working in cloud infrastructure, DevOps, or platform engineering.
